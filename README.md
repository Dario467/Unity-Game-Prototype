# Unity Game Prototype
## About The Project
This project is a prototype of a real-time strategy game with chess-like movement, developed in Unity (C#).

Although still in an early stage, the prototype focuses on building a robust gameplay foundation rather than complete game content.
Currently, it includes:
* Piece selection system
* intelligent highlighting that detects available movement cells dynamically using a smart grid system.
* Smooth piece movement and character animations.
* A good manage pf clicks and actions efficiently through Unityâ€™s Input System.
* A clean and scalable codebase, built following object-oriented programming principles and well-known game design patterns such as Observer and Strategy, among others.

The main goal of this prototype is to demonstrate strong architecture, maintainability, and system scalability, serving as a foundation for future real-time tactical gameplay
